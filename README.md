## Reveal.js Template

Got lots of talks coming up soon, my template to create some quick slides using markdown.

In the off chance that someone runs into this and wants to use this... (Why?)

### How To:
Edit the `source.md` file in `static` directory.\
Follow the basic guidelines mentioned there for using the slides.\
Voila!

### Todo
0. Figure out GitHub actions and see how to host stuff made from this.
1. Figure out how to use Catppuccin for both `reveal.js` and `highlight.js`.
2. Figure out ways to use multiple markdown files.
3. Figure out speaker notes.
4. Figure out native way to integrate svelte components with external markdown file.
5. Check if animations are possible by looking deeper into `marked.js`.
